# OMEGA Game Engine [WIP]
 
 This is an amalgamation of all my game engines that I made in the span of 10 years. Currently work in progress;
 
 **This is using**:
 
 - C# .NET 5.0
 - SDL2/[SDL2-CS][10] for window creation, graphics context, mouse, keyboard and gamepad input;
 - [BGFX][1] for low level graphics API abstraction;
 - [StbImageSharp][9] for image loading/writing;
 - Code fragments from [SharpBGFX][2] and [bgfx-cs][3] to help better abstract low level bindings;
 
 **This project has taken inspiration or is using code directly from:**
 
 - [Sokol][4]
 - [Vortex2D (RIP: First game engine I studied and used)][5]
 - [HGE Game Engine (RIP: One of the first game engines I've studied)][6]
 - [LibGDX][11]
 - [MonoGame][7]
 - [FNA][8]
